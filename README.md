This is the codebase for Aquastation's fork of [Paradise Station's codebase](https://github.com/ParadiseSS13/Paradise), [a fork of Baystation, which is a fork of /tg/station, which in turn is a fork of Goonstation, which, ultimately, is a fork of the original Space Station 13](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacestation13/SS13-Codebases/master/tree.png).

Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden, round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, or, in this case, a submarine, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive!

# Useful Documents and Links

## [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

All contributors are expected to read our Code of Conduct before they take part in our community.

## [Aquastation's Modularization Protocol](aqua/README.md)

The main guide on how to modularize any Aquastation-specific edits to the code, allowing it to be (somewhat) separate from the upstream.

## [Dream Maker (DM) Guide](https://secure.byond.com/docs/guide/)

The official guide by the creators of BYOND on how to get started with the Dream Maker language. While it was written with the Dream Maker IDE in mind and for version 2.0 of the engine, it still covers all the important details on how to use the DM language.

## [DM By Example](https://spacestation13.github.io/DMByExample/)

A (work in progress) guide on the DM language in the style of Rust By Example, for those who prefer a more hands-on approach for learning how the language works.

## [Dream Maker (DM) Reference](https://www.byond.com/docs/ref/)

This reference site by the creators of BYOND details information on the DM language, the syntax used, functionality of native procs, and a lot more. This is always useful to have on hand when contributing.

## [Paradise Station's Autodocumentation Guide](https://devdocs.paradisestation.org/references/autodoc/)

This guide shows you how to leave code comments that comply with "autodocumentation", a system designed to make everyone's lives easier when reading or reviewing code!

## [Paradise Station Community Maintained Guide to Contributing](https://devdocs.paradisestation.org/contributing/getting_started/)

This community maintained guide covers how to set yourself up for success when attempting to contribute to Paradise Station's codebase and, by extension, this one.

## [TGUI Tutorial](tgui/docs/tutorial-and-examples.md)

TGUI is a user interface framework, built on InfernoJS, for all new player-facing UIs.

TGUI is very different to most other BYOND user interfaces as it is written entirely in JavaScript with some data passed to and from DreamMaker. If you are looking to get to grips with TGUI, this tutorial is a good starting point. Additional information can also be found [here.](tgui)

## [Mapping Guide](https://hackmd.io/@tgstation/SyVma0dS5#san7890s-A-Z-Guide-to-Mapping)

Mapping for Aquastation can be daunting to new contributors. Here's a comprehensive quick-start put together by a community member that takes you from A-Z.
